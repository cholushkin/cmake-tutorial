# CMake tutorial
Here is my tutorial on CMake. I've revamped the official CMake tutorial and extensively utilized ChatGPT to craft a quality text. Tutorial applicable to Windows OS.

## CMake
CMake is a cross-platform build system generator. It is used to control the software compilation process using simple platform and compiler-independent configuration files. CMake generates native makefiles or project files that can be used in the compiler environment of your choice. The primary goal of CMake is to be able to compile source code on any platform without manual adjustments, making it ideal for projects that need to be built on multiple platforms (like Windows, macOS, and Linux).
