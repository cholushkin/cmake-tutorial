#CMake tutorial
Here is my tutorial on CMake and Conan. I've revamped the official CMake tutorial and extensively utilized ChatGPT to craft a quality text. Tutorial applicable to Windows OS.

##CMake
CMake is a cross-platform build system generator. It is used to control the software compilation process using simple platform and compiler-independent configuration files. CMake generates native makefiles or project files that can be used in the compiler environment of your choice. The primary goal of CMake is to be able to compile source code on any platform without manual adjustments, making it ideal for projects that need to be built on multiple platforms (like Windows, macOS, and Linux).

##Conan
Conan is an open-source, decentralized package manager for C and C++ languages. It simplifies the integration of third-party libraries into a project by managing binary packages and dependencies. Conan supports multi-platform systems and can integrate with any build system, automating the handling of various versions and configurations of libraries. This tool is essential for developers looking to streamline the development process in complex environments involving numerous external libraries.
